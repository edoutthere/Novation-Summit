Information and Utilities related to the Summit Synthesizer

I would appreciate feedback if you find these utilities to be useful. 

This repo is a collection of resources and utilities for the Novation Summit
synthesizer.

Since Focusrite does not supply utilities to break out and manage the contents of
summit (and peak) patches, I wrote them.

SummitDump dumps a peak/summit .syx file to text so you can see the settings
